function [x] = cvx_solve(X, A, B, epsilon_sparsity, epsilon_orthogonality, i, mode)
%% solves a convex optimzation
% input X*A - B, only solving for the ith column of X
%   Usage: [x] = cvx_solve(X, A, B, epsilon_sparsity, epsilon_orthogonality, i, mode)
%  Output: x which is the ith column of X
%   if mode == 'factors', it solves the following program
%    X * A - B
%   if mode == 'core', it solves the following program
%   A * X - B
%   This code depends on CVX Solver which is available at:
%          http://cvxr.com/cvx/
